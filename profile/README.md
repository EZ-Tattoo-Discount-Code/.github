## 🚀 What is EZ Tattoo Supply?

EZ Tattoo Supply — found at eztattoosupply.com — is the official global retail store of EZ Tattoo, one of the largest and most respected professional tattoo equipment manufacturers in the world. Founded in 2005 and built from the ground up around research, development, and production excellence, EZ has spent two decades engineering the machines, needles, inks, and accessories that professional tattoo artists across five continents rely on daily — with 90% of production exported internationally and a product footprint that spans professional studio tattoo machines, wireless pen machines, cartridge needles, stencil printers, PMU machines, practice skins, inks, grips, power supplies, and every consumable a working tattoo artist needs from first sketch to finished healed piece.

What separates EZ from every other tattoo equipment manufacturer is the relentless pace of genuine innovation it brings to a category that most brands treat as commodity hardware. The P3 Pro series — the flagship wireless pen machine lineup — introduced Bluetooth app control before it was standard in the category, adjustable stroke before most competitors offered it at any price, and the P3 Pro Touch brought a touchscreen power module with glove-friendly ultra-responsive touch controls that artists describe as the most practical interface upgrade in years. The V-Select Gold Series cartridge needles introduced a titanium-gold needle tip delivering three times the durability of standard stainless needles alongside a reinforced positioning system and double-hole ink flow design that professional artists describe as the most consistent and reliable cartridges they have used. The Revolution series covers every needle configuration from round liner through curved magnum with EZ's membrane system that prevents ink backflow and blowback, a standard feature on EZ cartridges that many competing brands charge a premium to include. With a US warehouse now open for faster domestic shipping, free global shipping on international orders, and a community of professional artists from apprentices to veterans who describe EZ as the machine their instructor recommended and the needle they use on every tattoo — EZ Tattoo Supply is the most complete single-source professional tattoo equipment store available in 2026.

## 💼 Why Choose EZ Tattoo Supply Over Other Tattoo Equipment Stores?

EZ Tattoo Supply has built a reputation as the most innovation-driven, artist-tested, and product-complete professional tattoo equipment store operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **The EZ P3 Pro series — the most advanced wireless pen machine lineup available to professional artists** — the P3 Pro, P3 Pro Turbo, and P3 Pro Touch represent the current state of the art in wireless tattoo pen machines, combining adjustable stroke, high-capacity 1600mAh to 2000mAh batteries, Bluetooth app control, and interchangeable power modules in a lightweight ergonomic chassis that professional artists describe as handling every style from fine line to large-scale Japanese with consistent, reliable performance across sessions lasting hours; the latest P3 Pro Touch adds a touchscreen power module with ultra-responsive controls that work even through gloves — an update that every artist in one reviewed shop had adopted within months of release
- **App control via Bluetooth — adjust stroke, voltage, and speed from your phone** — EZ machines with Bluetooth connectivity allow full parameter control from the EZ Tattoo app on iOS and Android, including stroke adjustment, voltage setting, speed calibration, and saved preset profiles for different needle configurations and skin types; artists who work across multiple styles describe the preset system as eliminating the setup time between clients by recalling the exact parameters for each needle and technique combination from a saved profile rather than adjusting manually for every session
- **Adjustable stroke — one machine covers every technique from lining to shading** — EZ's adjustable stroke mechanism allows artists to dial in the exact needle travel distance for the technique being used, from tight short strokes for fine line and dotwork through longer strokes for smooth colour packing and shading; the ability to cover the full technique range in a single machine rather than carrying separate machines for different stroke requirements is consistently cited by professional artists as the practical feature that makes EZ pen machines genuinely versatile rather than specialist instruments
- **V-Select Gold Series cartridge needles with titanium-gold Ti AU needle tip — 3x the durability of standard stainless** — the V-Select Gold Series introduces a world-first titanium-gold needle tip that lasts three times longer than standard stainless steel needles without any compromise in sharpness, consistency, or skin feel; the reinforced positioning system ensures every needle sits in exactly the same geometry relative to the cartridge housing for consistent depth and ink delivery across the entire session, and the double-hole ink flow design maintains smooth, uninterrupted ink supply without the clustering and drying that affects single-hole cartridge designs during extended work
- **Revolution Series cartridge needles — membrane system that prevents backflow and blowback across every configuration** — the Revolution Series is EZ's best-selling cartridge range, covering round liner, round shader, curved magnum, and magnum configurations with the membrane safety system that prevents ink backflow from the needle back into the machine grip during the stroke cycle; this contamination prevention mechanism, built into every EZ Revolution cartridge as standard, is a hygiene and machine longevity feature that many competing cartridge brands charge a significant premium to include or omit entirely at lower price points
- **Filter V2 cartridge needles with Two Shot Injection Molding Technology — an industry first** — the Filter V2 series uses a proprietary two-shot injection molding process for the cartridge housing that produces a more precise, tighter-tolerance component than single-shot molding allows, resulting in more consistent needle positioning, tighter clearances, and a more reliable membrane seal than conventionally manufactured cartridges; the Two Shot designation marks it as the first cartridge in the tattoo industry manufactured to this specification, reflecting EZ's position as an engineering-first company rather than a supply-chain aggregator
- **EZ P2S Portex and EZ Portex Generation 2S — the non-pen rotary option for artists who prefer grip machines** — for artists who prefer a traditional grip-style machine over a pen form factor, EZ's Portex Generation 2S delivers wireless battery operation and the same adjustable stroke performance as the P3 Pro series in a grip-forward design that artists transitioning from coil machines find more natural to hold; the battery system is compatible across multiple EZ wireless models, allowing a single spare battery to be shared across different machines in a multi-machine studio setup
- **EZ Tattoo Stencil Printer with iOS and Android app control** — the EZ stencil printer connects to the EZ Tattoo Printer app on iOS for direct-from-phone stencil printing, streamlining the workflow from design approval to stencil application without a dedicated computer or USB connection; the printer supports standard thermal stencil paper and is compatible with the full range of EZ stencil products, with troubleshooting resources and setup guides published on the EZ blog for artists managing the transition from hand-drawn stencil transfer
- **PMU and SMP-specific cartridges and machines in the same catalog** — EZ's product range covers permanent makeup and scalp micropigmentation alongside traditional tattooing, with dedicated PMU machines, PMU-specific V-Select cartridges, and microneedle cartridges for skin treatment applications available in the same store as the full tattoo lineup; artists and technicians who work across both tattooing and PMU can source every tool from a single supplier rather than maintaining separate relationships with specialist PMU equipment distributors
- **Practice skins for every level — from beginner to advanced** — EZ supplies silica practice skins in multiple sizes and thicknesses, including extra-thick large-format skins for extended practice sessions and POPU double-sided PMU practice pads designed to replicate the feel of real human skin for artists developing their technique before working on clients; apprentices whose instructors recommend EZ equipment describe the practice skins as a natural companion to the machines they are learning on, providing consistent resistance and ink take that matches the behaviour they will encounter on real skin
- **US warehouse now open for faster domestic shipping** — EZ Tattoo Supply launched a dedicated US warehouse in 2026 specifically to reduce delivery times for North American customers, giving domestic artists access to faster shipping on machines, needles, and accessories without the international transit times that previously applied to all orders; international orders continue to ship globally with free shipping, maintaining EZ's accessibility to artists in every market worldwide
- **360+ verified customer reviews with a consistent pattern of professional endorsement** — EZ Tattoo Supply's review base spans professional artists working in Japanese, fine line, realism, and colour styles across multiple continents, with consistent testimony that the P3 Pro machines handle every skin type, that the V-Select needles deliver the combination of sharpness and durability that sustains quality across a full day's work, and that the brand's reputation in the professional community reflects genuine performance rather than marketing spend

## 🔓 Reduce Your Supply Cost with SAVE10

EZ Tattoo Supply prices are already set to be accessible to professional artists and serious students without the inflated margins that brick-and-mortar distribution adds to competing brands — with wireless pen machines, professional cartridge needles, and full studio consumable bundles priced to reflect direct-from-manufacturer value rather than retail markup.

At 10% off, the saving on a P3 Pro machine order covers a box of Revolution cartridges. The saving on a bulk needle order covers a set of practice skins. Whether stocking a new studio setup from scratch or replenishing consumables for a busy working practice, SAVE10 makes every EZ Tattoo Supply order go further without compromising on the professional quality that the brand's two-decade track record of engineering innovation and artist endorsement is built on.
